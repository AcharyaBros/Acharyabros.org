            Yooooo thank you for visiting!!!<br><br>
            This is my new game company. I'm a solo developer, but there are going to be images you can press to play my games soon. 
            I'm still figuring things out and learning how to code, but by February, I will try to make a FNAF-styled game. 
            See you soon!
